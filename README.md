# Eu-Zin Calorie Tracking Application 🍏💪

Welcome to Eu-Zin, a university project developed in Java. Eu-Zin is an application designed to help users track their calorie intake, monitor food consumption, schedule appointments with dietitians, and keep tabs on calories burned through exercise. This project showcases the iterative progress of app development, starting from defining worst cases and use cases to robustness diagrams and sequence diagrams.

## Key Features:

### 1. Calorie Tracking 📊
Effortlessly monitor and track your daily calorie intake. Eu-Zin provides a user-friendly interface to log and manage the food consumed, giving you insights into your nutritional habits.

### 2. Dietitian Appointments 📅

## Project Showcase:

Eu-Zin is not just an application; it's a journey through the development process:

1. **Use Case Definition:**
   - Clearly defined worst cases and use cases to guide the development process.

2. **Robustness Diagrams:**
   - Illustrations of the system's robustness, providing a high-level overview of its interactions with external entities.

3. **Sequence Diagrams:**
   - Visual representation of the flow of actions within the application, showcasing the dynamic aspects of the system.
